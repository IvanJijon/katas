# Welcome to my _katas_ repository

What are katas? From Wikipedia:
> Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practice their craft.

In this repository you will find my solutions to the multiple katas that have helped me train my skills.

## Why this repository?

First, it helps me keep track of my training. Even if I have done many katas in the past that are not in this repository I find it useful to have my solutions somewhere easily accessible and organized.

Second, it is somehow a **portfolio**. If you are here because you are considering hiring me, you can have a quick idea of my skills.

If you are interested in my programming skills, you can also find my solutions to Advent of Code challenges here:
- [Advent of Code 2021](https://github.com/IvanJijon/AdventOfCode2021)
- [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/IvanJijon/AdventOfCode2022)

So please, don't hesitate to take a look at my code. :wink:

## Programming languages (PL)

I pretend to use TypeScript, Python and Golang since those are the languages I work the most with.

## Repository structure

The `templates` folder contains an environment setup for each PL ready to be used for kata training. It helps me win a lot of time.

Since a kata can be solved in many PLs a prefix is added for each kata: `TS-` for TypeScript, `PY-` for Python and `GO-` for Golang.

In the root folder of each kata you will find a README file with some comments that will guide you through my train of thoughts when solving the katas, the approach I took, the challenges I focused on, etc...

Enjoy :smile:.
